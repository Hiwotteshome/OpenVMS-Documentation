## System-Call Description 
This project demonstrates how to receive data from a socket using the recvfrom() system call. It includes a simple program that creates a UDP socket, waits for incoming datagrams, and reads the data along with the senderâ€™s address information. The implementation helps illustrate how user-space applications receive network data and identify the source, making it essential for building network tools, servers, and communication protocols.
